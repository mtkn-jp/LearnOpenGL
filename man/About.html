  Hi, my name is <a href="http://joeydevries.com" target="_blank">Joey de Vries</a> and I'm the sole author of LearnOpenGL. As you have probably guessed, I'm a computer graphics enthusiast.
</p>

<p>
  Computer graphics have always been a strong interest of mine, either because I enjoyed the visuals of movie effects and video games, or simply liked moving pixels. It wasn't until joining a computer science program at Utrecht University that I started to take programming and computer graphics seriously. I developed a strong eagerness to learn computer graphics (specifically OpenGL) and video game development, honing these skills as a hobby alongside my studies; using a multitude of online tutorials similar to sites like this. However, I always felt that the available online tutorials regarding OpenGL were either incomplete, contained errors or try to be overly complicated for no good reason. Therefore, it's always been in my mind to set up an OpenGL tutorial resource one day that tries to overcome these hurdles.

	Around June 2014 I published this website and started generating a large batch of content for everyone to enjoy. I am continuously striving to create one of the best OpenGL resources while also making it easy-to-understand and fun to learn. This means I will try to add as much content as I see fit and frequently revisit old chapters to improve their content. By now I have over 5 years of professional industry experience, both in WebGL/OpenGL and as a AAA game engine developer. This experience translates in continuous improvements on Learn OpenGL as I fix mistakes, improve explanations, and learn better approaches to teaching. Let me know what you think of the site in the comments or by contacting me <a href="mailto:learnopengl.com@gmail.com">personally</a> and let's try to together make this the number one resource for learning modern OpenGL!
